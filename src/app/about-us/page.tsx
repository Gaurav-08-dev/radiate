            We&apos;re a women-led startup from Delhi, creating handmade
            candles that do more than just light up your space. Radiate
            Candles was born from a belief in bringing warmth, love, and care
            to every moment. Each scent is rooted in Indian heritage,
            thoughtfully crafted to evoke nostalgia and celebrate our culture.
            A familiar fragrance can soothe the soul, boost memory, and
            connect us to cherished momentsâ€”making each Radiate candle a
            heartfelt gift and a piece of home, wherever you are.
